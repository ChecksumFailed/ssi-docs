To set up this feature, click **Folder Synchronization** from the **Administration** menu.

>**Note**: For the ability to edit these settings, an administrator must be assigned a role within Secret Server containing the Administer ConnectWise
Integration permission.

Enabling Folder Synchronization will require specifying the synchronization interval in days, hours, and minutes. Folder to Synchronize references the
parent folder where Secret Server will create the ConnectWise companies as child folders.

## Creating the ConnectWise Integrator Login

If an integrator login doesnâ€™t exist in ConnectWise, create one by following the steps in [this KB.](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?ConnectWiseIntegratorLogin) <!-- pull this KB in here and delete the link.-->

Enter the hostname of your ConnectWise instance, your company id, and select the Secret of the ConnectWise integrator login.

Figure 2 shows the result of synchronization with ConnectWise. A folder has been created in Secret Server for each company and placed in the folder tree based on the company type, status, and name in ConnectWise.
