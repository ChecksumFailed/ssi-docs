# Blue Prism Integration with Secret Server

Blue Prism makes enterprise robotic process automation (RPA) software that provides a digital workforce designed to automate complex, end-to-end operational activities. The product is built on the Microsoft .NET Framework. It automates any application and supports any platform (mainframe, Windows, WPF, Java, web, etc.); and can be consumed in a variety of ways (terminal emulator, thick client, thin client, web browser, Citrix and web services).

The integration between Secret Server and Blue Prism ensures that:

* Passwords are securely vaulted in Secret Server
* Blue Prism bots can request passwords whenever they are needed
* All access by bots is captures in Secret Server Audit Trail
* Role-based access controls limit which passwords each bot can use
