# Getting Started with SafeNet Luna

Supported Platforms
-------------------

List of the platforms which are tested with the following HSMs:

**SafeNet Luna HSM**: It is a standalone network-attached appliance that
physically and logically secure cryptographic keys and cryptographic processing.
The purpose of an HSM is to protect sensitive data from being stolen by
providing a highly secure operation structure. HSMs are fully contained and
complete solutions for cryptographic processing, key generation, and key
storage.

This integration is verified with SafeNet Luna HSM on the following operating
systems:

-   Windows 2016 Server

**SafeNet Data Protection on Demand (DPoD)**: It is a cloud-based platform that
provides on-demand HSM and key management services through a simple graphical
user interface. With DPoD, security is simple, cost effective, and easy to
manage because there is no hardware to buy, deploy, and maintain. As an
Application Owner, you click and deploy services, generate usage reports and
maintain only the services that you need.

This integration is verified with SafeNet DPoD on the following operating
systems:

-   Windows 2016 Server
