**Integrating Secret Server for Authenticated Scans**

Administrators can add credentials to the Qualys tool for use in trusted scans
without the use of a password management solution. Qualys can also use Secret
Server as a repository for the accounts used for authenticated scanning. Using
Secret Server means that all the credentials used for authenticated scans will
be stored securely on-premises and will not leave the network.
