# Creating Authentication Records

Once the authentication vault has been configured, individual authentication credentials can be configured to retrieve their passwords from Secret Server.

1. To create an Authentication Record (Windows, Unix, Oracle, Oracle Listener, MS SQL Server, and IBM DB2 authentication vault integration is supported by Qualys today), select the __record type__ from the menu in the __Authentication__ tab.

1. The Authentication Vault configuration requires three additional details to retrieve the password:

   * __Vault Type:__ This should be set to Thycotic Secret Server

   * __Vault Title:__ This is the name of the previously created Authentication Vault
record in Qualys.

   * __Secret Name:__ This is the Secret record in Secret Server that contains the password of the account. In this case, Secret Name for the Windows Account is Qualystest.

   >**Note:** The Secret Name must match exactly the corresponding Secret Name in Secret Server.

   >**Note:** Ensure that the Secret Name exactly matches the name specified in Qualys. In addition to creating a Secret with the correct password for the credential used for authenticated scanning, the Qualys user account must be granted at least View access to the Secret. Click __Share__ to view the permissions on the Secret.

In this case the Secret inherits permissions from the folder settings, which is generally a best practice.

You can view the folder level permissions by editing the folder the Secret is in.

Once the Secret is configured with the proper permission, Qualys can use it in scans. Run a scan that uses that authentication record to verify that everything is working end-to-end.
