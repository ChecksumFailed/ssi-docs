# Automation Anywhere Integration with Secret Server

Automation Anywhereâ€™s platform employs software robots, or bots, that make business processes self-running. The application uses a combination of traditional RPA and cognitive elements such as unstructured data processing and natural language understanding to learn and observe human behavior.

The integration between Secret Server and Automation Anywhere ensures that:

* Passwords are securely vaulted in Secret Server
* All access by bots is captures in Secret Server Audit Trail 
* Role-based access controls limit which passwords each bot can use
