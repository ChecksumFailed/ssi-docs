# Okta for SAML Integration

This document is to serve as the configuration document for integrating Okta for SAML and Secret Server.

Secret Server acts as a SAML Service Provider that can communicate with Okta for authentication. This allows Secret Server the use of SAML Identity Provider (IdP) authentication instead of the normal authentication process for single sign-on (SSO). To do this, Secret Server acts as a SAML Service Provider (SP) that can communicate with any configured SAML IdP, including Okta.
