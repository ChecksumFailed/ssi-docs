# Verifying the Integration

To test this, login to Okta as the user, then browse to your Secret Server instance. The user should be logged in automatically to Secret Server without prompting for login credentials.

If SLO is configured, logging out of Secret Server as the user will also log them out of Okta. 

Also refer to [Advanced Settings](advanced.md) for further configuration options.
