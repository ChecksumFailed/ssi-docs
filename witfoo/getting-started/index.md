# Getting Started with WitFoo Precinct Integration

WitFoo Precinct can be deployed as an all-in-one appliance for organizations
with less than 10,000 events per second (EPS). It can also be deployed in a
horizontally & vertically scaling architecture to allow for millions of events
per second and long-term retention and processing. Steps in this section are provided for appliance deployment.
