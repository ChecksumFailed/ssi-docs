# Template Root File

The int-template folder contains the template structure and template files for integration documents.

1. Make a copy of the template folder at the root of the integration repo.
1. Rename the folder to reflect the actual integration product name.
1. The metadata tag `[display]: # (none)` need to be removed to changed to `[display]: # (all)` once real contents is created and ready for publication.
1. Each contents section needs an images folder if screen captures are part of the markdown files. Refer to the Okta for SAML folder to see an example on where/when the images folder is required. We cannot stage a template structure with images folders in place, empty folders cannot be committed into a repo.
