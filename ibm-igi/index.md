# IBM IGI

The integration between Thycotic Secret Server and IBM IGI is created and maintained by IBM. This document provides guidance and best practice for implementing the integration. It is based on the following publicly available documentation from IBM and testing performed by Thycotic. Integrations are supported to the extent of the third-party product procedures documented for this integration. Please contact the third-party for any customized setup of the integrated product.

IBM Secret Server now integrates with IBM Identity Governance & Intelligence (IGI) to provide an enhanced privileged identity and access governance solution. IBM Secret Server securely
stores privileged credentials and other sensitive
information, known as secrets, and provides visibility
into who has access to those secrets. IGI ensures
that users’ access levels are compliant with
regulations and prevents SoD violations.

By integrating these two products, organizations can
centrally manage and control all identities, including
privileged identities and entitlements. Compliance
use cases such as managing entitlements,
certification, new user provisioning and application
access permissions are now unified for both
privileged and non-privileged users

This integration unifies processes for privileged and
non-privileged users. It ensures that privileged users
are granted appropriate access permissions based
on similar privileged users’ attributes (e.g. job role,
department), and in accordance with the
organization’s access policy. It reduces the attack
surface and enhances regulatory compliance by
limiting access privileges and deactivating orphan
privileged accounts. It streamlines governance and
compliance processes by generating reports and
auditing all identities and access permissions
directly from IGI.
