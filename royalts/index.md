# Introduction

The integration between Thycotic Secret Server and Royal TS is created and maintained by Royal TS. This document provides guidance and best practice for implementing the integration. It is based on the following publicly available documentation from the vendor and testing performed by Thycotic.

### Secret Server

Thycotic Secret Server (SS) is an on-premises Web-based password vault used throughout the world to help organizations properly manage privileged account passwords. SS allows users to control access and automate password changes for a variety of enterprise resources, such as servers, databases, network devices, and applications. SS features auditing throughout the application and role-based access control (RBAC) on all of its information and features. Organizations can easily deploy SS to ensure security, reduce labor costs, adopt password best practices, and satisfy audit requirements.

### Royal TS

Royal TS (Terminal Services), called RTS in this document, provides powerful, easy and secure access to remote systems for server admins, system engineers, developers and others who need to access remote systems using different protocols. RTS supports RDP, VNC, SSH, HTTP/S, and more. It is available for Windows, OS X, iOS and Android, and RTS documents open on all those platforms. See [http://www.royalts.com](http://www.royalts.com/) or more information.

### Royal TS and Secret Server Integration

SS randomizes and stores passwords for accounts on target systems on a regular recurring basis. Because these passwords are stored and managed in a vault, they can be retrieved via a SOAP or REST Web service. RTS integrates with SS via a PowerShell script, provided by RTS. Specifically, SS integrates with the RTS dynamic folder feature.
