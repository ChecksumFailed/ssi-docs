# Using Splunk

## Overview

You can easily correlate Secret Server syslog data using Splunk’s field-extraction
capabilities. Secret Server’s detailed Syslog currently contains 44 different events,
tracking more than 20 unique data fields.

## Accessing Secret Server Events in the SplunkCloud

Login to SplunkCloud and click on __search and Reporting and__ enter the query: `source=”syslog”` and click __Search icon__.

## Example: Tracking Frequent Use

You could create a `full_suser` custom extraction field that extracts fields
that have a space in the reported data, a user’s full name in this case. By
default, Splunk identifies SS users by their User ID, as stored in the database,
which is represented as their user number.

You could create a count-based table using the `full_suser` field extraction.
Put the following term into the search field in Splunk where `<instance>` is the
Secret Server syslog-specific data:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
source="<instance>" "SECRET - VIEW" stats count by suid,full_suser | table suid full_suser count | search count > 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Secret Server Reported Events
