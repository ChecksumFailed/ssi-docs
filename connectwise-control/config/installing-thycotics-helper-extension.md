# Installing Thycotic’s Helper Extension

The installation instructions below are largely derived from [ConnectWise University’ Extension Development Guide](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Control_Documentation/Developers/Extension_development_guide).

## What's the process?

To create an extension with ConnectWise Control, you'll have to follow this process:

1. __Get a developer instance__. A developer instance has a special license that allows you to develop and test your extensions.

1. __Create your extension__ and test it in your developer instance. Download the Extension Developer extension to get started.
