# Integration Requirements

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have an API user account that has, at minimum, view permissions on the Secrets with which you are going to integrate. The API account has been associated to the built-in user role and has explicitly only been assigned view
access to the Secrets with which we integrate. For Rapid7, the minimum permissions required for the Nexpose related API account has not yet been isolated. Currently, customers are providing "admin" site specific Rapid7 permissions.
