# Troubleshooting

The most common script errors are configuration based, such as users without
permission to update sites or query credentials from SS. To troubleshoot:

-   Ensure secrets have the same name in Nexpose and in SS. (IP address or short
    name hostname only for secret name and machine name.)

-   Ensure the cited Nexpose user can save sites and start scans.

-   If issues still exist, email <support@rapid7.com>.

-   The encryption.config file mentioned at the bottom of the configuration file
    does not reference Thycoticâ€™s encryption.config file, nor does it need
    copied to the location specified for this integration to work.

-   Ensure the nexpose_url reflects the actual IP address assigned to the
    network adapter attached to the system running the script and not a
    localhost value.

-   If issues still exist, email support\@rapid7.com.
