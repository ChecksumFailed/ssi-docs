# Scalability

Credential aliases for Discovery allow control over which credentials a given schedule is allowed to access. This prevents the unnecessary exposure of any elevated credentials. Multiple credentials can be assigned to a single alias, allowing you to configure a set of credentials to use across different systems in our environment.

Creating credential aliases for Discovery is documented under the `Connections and Credentials` for our deployed release of ServiceNow.

Below are a few example screenshots of a Windows-based credential linked to a Credential Alias and then a screenshot of that being linked in a Discovery Schedule:
