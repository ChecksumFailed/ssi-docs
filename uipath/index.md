# UiPath Integration with Secret Server

UiPath Orchestrator is a web application that enables you to deploy, schedule, monitor and manage Robots and processes through  centralized work queues. Please visit UiPath's website for [further information](https://www.uipath.com/developers/video-tutorials/introduction-to-uipath).

The Secret Server integration is read only. When an asset or robot is created in UI Path Orchestrator it is linked to a pre-existing secret using the Secret Id.

The integration uses the Secret Server SDK, which is documented in more detail here: https://github.com/thycotic/sdk-documentation.
